Pass a string and a number to Cipher method
Convert string to an array with every letter as a different element
Check if current element belongs to upper case letters or lower case letters
    str = 77.chr            # "M"
    s2  = 233.chr("UTF-8")  # "Ã©"
    num = "M".ord           # 77
make us out of these methods ^^^
make a method that checks if number of letters shifted is bigger than there are letters left in alphabet
don't forget to wrap from z to a
if letter has a charcode of for example 80 and we subtract initial value from it (in that case initial value is 65) we'll get a value of 15 which represents how many shifts we have
to do from starting position to the current letter
